## About Me

I am an ALX Backend Web Development learner with a focused interest in building robust, maintainable server-side applications. My journey into software engineering is driven by a fascination with how **technology** and **AI** can solve real-world problems. I aim to become the best version of myself in software development by continuously learning and shipping practical projects.

**Focus areas:** Backend APIs, Databases, Authentication, Testing, Deployment, and System Design.

**Current goals:**
- Build a production-ready **Point of Sale (POS)** for retail shops.
- Build a **School Management System** that simplifies administrative workflows.
- Prepare a professional portfolio that helps me land backend roles.

## How I Work

1. **Understand requirements** — Clarify outcomes before coding.
2. **Design simply** — Favor readable solutions and clear APIs.
3. **Test everything** — Unit + integration tests for backend logic.
4. **Automate** — CI pipelines for tests and deployments.
5. **Document** — OpenAPI (Swagger) for APIs and README for every repo.
